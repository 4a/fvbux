these things should happen eventually

---- bets.php - Moderation ----

1) must be able to choose a winner.

2) people who bet on the winner must be paid
maybe something like:

daigo wins

bets_matches
set the winner column to 'daigo'
match status = 'closed'

update bets_money where match = matchid

check bets_money for any rows where 'status' is still 'open'
set them to 'closed' and refund user1name the bet value

set status where 'locked' to 'closed'
rows where daigo = user1choice, winner = user1name
rows where daigo != user1choice, winner = user2name

then update the rows in user
for each row in bets_money where match = matchid
add 'value'x2 to rows in user table where 'username'='winner'

mayamayafey (7:04:16 PM): UPDATE user SET points = points + ($betvalue * 2) WHERE username IN (SELECT winner FROM bets_money WHERE match = $matchid)

3) pay the moderator some amount based on how many individual bets were completed.
stuff no one challenged shouldnt count.

4) moderator should have some control over when betting can happen. prevent people
   from being lame and challenging someone's bet when a match becomes extremely one sided.
   probably need to take advantage of the 'locked' and 'closed' statuses in bets_matches.

---- createbet.php ----

cheating should be prevented if possible

1) *DONE* check if username is the mod name and if ip is the mod ip



---- players.php ----

1) needs some user specific stuff on profiles:

fvbux
bet history
location?
consoles?
fighting games you like playing?
just rip off eventhubs fight tracker?

2) needs a main page when no user profile parameter is set.
   should show relevant information like matches happening right now or something.
---- general ----

1) maybe rename some of the files, we have players, bets, playerbet. its kind of confusing.

2) general style changes. rick should probably decide aesthetic.

3) better error messages?
